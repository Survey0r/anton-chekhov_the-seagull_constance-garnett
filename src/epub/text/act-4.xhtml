			<p>One of the drawing-rooms in <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Sorin’s</b> house, which has been turned into a study for <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Konstantin Treplev</b>. On the right and left, doors leading to inner apartments. In the middle, glass door leading on to the verandah. Besides the usual drawing-room furniture there is, in corner on right, a writing-table, near door on left, a sofa, a bookcase and books in windows and on the chairs. Evening. There is a single lamp alight with a shade on it. It is half dark. There is the sound of the trees rustling, and the wind howling in the chimney. A watchman is tapping. Enter <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Medvedenko</b> and <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Masha</b>.</p>
